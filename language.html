Telugu one of the classical languages of India is the official language of Telangana and Urdu is the second official language of the state.About 75% of the population of Telangana speak Telugu and 12% speak Urdu.After 1948, once Hyderabad State joined the new Republic of India, Telugu became the language of government, and as Telugu was introduced as the medium of instruction in schools and colleges, the use of Urdu among non-Hyderabadi Muslims decreased.The Urdu spoken in Telangana is called Hyderabadi Urdu, which in itself is a dialect of the larger Dakhini Urdu dialects of South India.
